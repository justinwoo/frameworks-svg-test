# frameworks-svg-test
test of various JS frameworks for rendering a bunch of SVG rectangles

# Why?
I routinely render large numbers of items, and so do many others. I also want to be able to render my entire application off of a collection.

See gh-pages demo [here](http://kimagure.github.io/frameworks-svg-test)
